# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition based on various factors using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about employees, including job roles, department, age, gender, and other relevant features.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python (3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Install the required packages:

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
2. Open the Employee_Attrition.ipynb notebook.

3. Execute the cells to load the dataset, explore the data, preprocess features, and train the Random Forest Classifier.

## Features
- Data Exploration: Analyze and visualize the dataset to gain insights into employee attrition patterns.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.

- Model Training: Use a Random Forest Classifier to train the model on the preprocessed data.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

## Visualizations
- Distribution of Attrition:
- Job Role vs. Attrition:
- Over Time vs. Attrition:
- Department vs. Attrition:
- Age Distribution:

## Model Evaluation
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy score of approximately 96% on the test set.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to predict employee attrition and understand the factors contributing to it.
